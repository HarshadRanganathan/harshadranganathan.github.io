# 𝐏𝐫𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐌𝐞𝐞𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐁𝐮𝐫𝐧𝐨𝐮𝐭: 𝐌𝐲 𝐆𝐨𝐥𝐝𝐞𝐧 𝐑𝐮𝐥𝐞𝐬 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐲𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞 🌟

In a perfect world, meeting hosts would only invite necessary participants, schedule meetings at appropriate frequencies, and have clear agendas. But let's face it, that doesn't always happen. To avoid meeting burnout and stay focused on delivery, here's what I do instead:

✨ **𝐑𝐮𝐥𝐞 #𝟏: Remove Unnecessary Meetings 🚫**

- At the end of each day, I delete meetings from my calendar for the next day that I'm not planning to attend. This helps me focus my activities for the following day.

✨ **𝐑𝐮𝐥𝐞 #𝟐: Categorize Meetings with Colors 🔴🟡**

- I categorize meetings by labeling them with colors: red (must attend) and yellow (optional, I will join if time permits or I might be needed).

✨ **𝐑𝐮𝐥𝐞 #𝟑: Handle Recurring Meetings Smartly 🔄**

- For daily recurring meetings where I'm occasionally needed, I either categorize them as yellow or delete them. I join only when I'm pinged and asked to.

✨ **𝐑𝐮𝐥𝐞 #𝟒: Manage Daily Overload 📅**

- If my calendar is overloaded for the day, I move any meetings that I have control over to other days to free up my schedule.

✨ **𝐑𝐮𝐥𝐞 #𝟓: Be a Thoughtful Meeting Host 🧠**

When hosting meetings:

- Invite only the necessary participants
- Set a clear agenda
- Schedule at the appropriate frequency
- For recurring meetings, use a top-down approach:
  - ❓Can it be quarterly
  - ❓Can it be bi-monthly
  - ❓Can it be monthly
  - ❓Can it be weekly
  - 🚫 Avoid starting with a daily frequency unless needed

Adopt these rules to avoid burnout and stay laser-focused on delivering your best work! 💪
